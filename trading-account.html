                        <p>If selected, you'll undergo an evaluation period where you'll trade a simulated or funded account provided by the firm. During this period, the firm will assess your trading performance, risk management skills, and adherence to their trading rules and guidelines.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="single">

                    </div>
                    <div class="single">

                    <h3>Cons of Joining a Futures Proprietary Trading Firm:</h3>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Deciding between setting up a Tradovate broker account and joining a futures proprietary trading firm depends on your individual preferences, trading style, and goals. Setting up a Tradovate broker account offers flexibility, accessibility, and commission-free trading, making it suitable for self-directed traders looking to trade futures and options on futures independently. On the other hand, joining a futures proprietary trading firm provides access to capital, professional support, and performance-based compensation, making it an attractive option for traders seeking opportunities to trade with larger positions and potentially increase their profitability. Consider your trading objectives, risk tolerance, and preferences carefully before making a decision, and explore both options to determine which best aligns with your needs and aspirations as a trader.</p>
